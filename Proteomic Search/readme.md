# Proteomic Search

A search for peptides arising from PRF was performed on a large bottom-up proteomic dataset including six human cell lines, digested with six different enzymes, fractionated, and analyzed by tandem MS with HCD/CAD and ETD fragmentation.

Please see the readme.md in the 'MSFragger Pipeline' subdirectory for details on the FragPipe search strategy, example files, data analysis and reporting of results.
